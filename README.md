We use an RDF dump from the LinkedBrainz project (http://linkedbrainz.c4dmpresents.org/content/rdf-dump) based on the MusicBrainz Database (http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database) to generate a noisy knowledge graph for the music domain. 

Our graph has missing node labels, spurious node labels, missing relations, and  noisy entities co-referent with entities found in the true graph.
